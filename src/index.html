          Refactoring
        </h1>
        <p>Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.</p>
        <p>
          Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a "refactoring") does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a
          significant restructuring. Since each refactoring is small, it's less likely to go wrong. The system is kept fully working after each refactoring, reducing the chances that a system can get
          seriously broken during the restructuring.
